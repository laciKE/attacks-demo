Please be aware that this repository can contain vulnerable applications and proof-of-concepts for exploiting these vulnerabilities. In some cases, Dockerfiles provided here can download/build/use tools and frameworks used by the security professionals as well as by the attackers for conducting cyber attacks. For example, Metasploit framework or various exploits and helper scripts. These tools can be flagged by antiviruse/antimalware software even when they are executed in Docker/Podman. Please, do not execute any content here directly on your hosts, always use the safe environment. E.g. virtual machines, Docker/Podman containers or virtual machines with the Docker/Podman containers :-)

*Remember, it is always a good idea to review the similar content before its execution.*
